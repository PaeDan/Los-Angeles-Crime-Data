## Data Analysis on Los Angeles Crime Data from 2020 - 2023
# Main focus on Identity Theft

The dataset used in this analysis is from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudhanvahg/crimes-in-las-angeles/data) where there are 28 columns of data 

Main key questions I wanted to solve in this Analysis was
1. Which area has the most crime committed
2. Which area has the most identity theft incidents
3. Did identity theft increase or decrease over the years
4. What were the majority of the victims classified as 
5. Are the cases still ongoing or resolved
